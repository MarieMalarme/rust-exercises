// Write a program that prints a riddle, receives input from the user
// and checks that the answer is correct

// The program must allow indefinite number of trials and only quit after the
// correct answer is given

// Every time the user introduces an incorrect answer the program must
// print the riddle
// Before quitting the program must print the number of trials

// Riddle: I am the beginning of the end, and the end of time and
// space. I am essential to creation, and I surround every place. What
// am I?

// Answer: The letter e
